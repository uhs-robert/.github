# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes will generally be applied to the latest release only, unless otherwise noted in the project’s README or Discussions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or vulnerability:

- **Do not open a public issue or pull request.**
- Instead, please email: **security@uphillsolutions.tech**
- Include as much detail as possible:
  - Affected version(s)
  - Reproduction steps
  - Potential impact
  - Suggested mitigation or patch (if any)

We aim to respond promptly, typically within a few business days. If the issue is confirmed, we’ll coordinate a disclosure process and patch timeline.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure. Public disclosure will occur after:

- A patch is released or mitigation is documented
- A mutually agreed-upon timeline with the reporter
- Or, no response from the reporter within 30 days of our patch
